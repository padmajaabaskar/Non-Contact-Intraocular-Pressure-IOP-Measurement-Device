# Non-Contact-Intraocular-Pressure-IOP-Measurement-Device
This project aims to develop a portable, non-contact device for Intraocular Pressure (IOP) measurement using an ESP32-CAM module. By utilizing real-time image processing, it measures corneal deformation caused by a controlled air-puff, offering a low-cost, contactless alternative to traditional tonometry.
