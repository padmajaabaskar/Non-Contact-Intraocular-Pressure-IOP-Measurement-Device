This project aims to develop a portable, non-contact device for measuring Intraocular Pressure (IOP) using an ESP32-CAM module. By leveraging real-time image processing to measure corneal deformation caused by a controlled air-puff, the device offers a low-cost, contactless alternative to traditional tonometry methods. This approach significantly reduces patient discomfort and infection risk while maintaining clinical accuracy. The device works by analyzing the deformation of the cornea, providing a safer and more comfortable experience for patients compared to conventional contact-based methods.

The solution has been validated through software simulation, and algorithmic calibration has been completed. At present, the hardware components, including the air pulse delivery system and optical imaging module, are under development. The prototype is being designed with a custom air nozzle and features wireless edge computing via the ESP32-CAM for efficient processing and data transmission. The real-time processing leverages frame-by-frame image analysis using OpenCV to ensure accurate pressure estimation through corneal applanation.

Looking ahead, the focus will be on completing and testing the hardware prototype, including the air pulse delivery and corneal imaging systems. The integration of machine learning algorithms for real-time IOP estimation will be a key next step, followed by validation against standard clinical tonometry methods to benchmark accuracy. A user interface will also be developed to facilitate operation and result visualization. Ultimately, the goal is to deploy the device in clinical or community settings for usability studies and refinement based on user feedback.
